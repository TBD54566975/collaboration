# TBD Development Roadmap

Welcome to the TBD Development Roadmap. Here we describe the high-level focus of
our efforts, chunked into time-boxed deliverables as Milestones. This approach 
lets teams operate with autonomy, while ensuring that everyone moves in the 
same direction.

Milestones are encoded as a set of goals, defined by the 
[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) model. Goals are:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Relevant
* Time-bound

Specificity is fluid. Because we are time-boxed, we make delivery estimates on 
a best-case scenario and adapt as the milestone progresses. Work may have delays
due to any number of factors, and we employ a blameless culture when goals 
must be rescoped. When we find our estimates are off, we simply communicate 
our position to the team via Discussions where we can collectively assess impact
and adapt as necessary.

Relevance may also be fluid, leaving room to adapt our work to the changing 
needs of the community. We reduce disruption here by releasing Milestones at 
frequent, predicable intervals (typically 6-8 weeks).

Milestones will have minimum requirements, and in these cases we prioritize
work around themes. Missing a theme indicates a loss of focus and can hold up
others, so we take care to communicate our objectives here and stay true to them
during development.

Let's go.
