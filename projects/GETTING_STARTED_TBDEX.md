# Getting Started with tbDEX

`tbDEX` is a liquidity protocol. It's the first application to be developed by TBD built atop the Decentralized Web Platform. Its [whitepaper](https://tbdex.io/whitepaper.pdf) outlines a "protocol (that) facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for
establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials
(VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real world".

Building `tbDEX` as a specification and message format is work that will follow the foundational projects under active development with the [Decentralized Web Platform (DWP)](./GETTING_STARTED_DWP.md).
